    - It measures distance between numerical features using Euclidean distance (like K-means) but also measure the distance between categorical features using the number of matching categories.

    - It calculates Euclidean distances for numerical variables and Similarities for categorical variables
    - The cost is a combined similarity measure for both numeric and categorical variables calculated between the objects and the cluster prototypes
