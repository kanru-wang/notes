# The meaning of common probability distributions

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions

- Binomial: describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments all with the same probability of success.
- Beta-binomial: describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments with each success following a beta distribution.
- Geometric: describes the number of attempts needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials, or alternatively only the number of losses before the first success (i.e. one less).
- Negative binomial: a generalization of the geometric distribution to the nth success.
- Poisson: a very large number of individually unlikely events that happen in a certain time interval.
- Beta: useful in estimating success probabilities.
- Chi-squared: describes the sum of the squares of n independent Gaussian random variables. It is a special case of the Gamma distribution, and it is used in goodness-of-fit tests in statistics.
- Exponential: describes the time between consecutive rare random events in a process with no memory.
- F-distribution: describes the distribution of the ratio of two (normalized) chi-squared-distributed random variables, used in the analysis of variance.
- Gamma: describes the time until n consecutive rare random events occur in a process with no memory.
- Log-normal: describes variables which can be modelled as the product of many small independent positive variables.
- Pareto: “Power law”
- Weibull: describes the lifetime of technical devices, and the particle size distribution.
- Student's T: estimates the unknown mean of a Gaussian population.
