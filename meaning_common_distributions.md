# The meaning of common probability distributions

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions

----------------------

- Binomial: describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments all with the same probability of success.
- Beta-binomial: describes the number of successes in a series of independent Yes/No experiments with each success following a Beta distribution.
- Geometric: describes the number of attempts needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials, or alternatively only the number of losses before the first success (i.e. one less).
- Negative binomial: a generalization of the geometric distribution to the nth success.

----------------------

- Poisson: describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.
- Exponential: describes the time between consecutive rare random events in a process with no memory.
- Gamma: describes the time until n consecutive rare random events occur in a process with no memory.
- Weibull: describes the lifetime of technical devices, and the particle size distribution.

----------------------

- Chi-squared: describes the sum of the squares of n independent Gaussian random variables. It is a special case of the Gamma distribution, and it is used in goodness-of-fit tests.
- F-distribution: describes the distribution of the ratio of two (normalized) chi-squared-distributed random variables, used in ANOVA.

----------------------

- Log-normal: describes the product of many small independent positive variables.
- Pareto: “Power law”
- Student's T: estimates the unknown mean of a Gaussian population.
