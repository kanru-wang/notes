### Advantages of using Machine Learning platforms

- Model Registry
    - Manage model versions and keep corresponding validation/test metrics
    - Manage the approval status of a model
- Feature Store
- Automatically adjust the number of instances during inference
- Debugging report that can detect CPU/GPU bottleneck or low utilization, I/O bottleneck, GPU memory bottleneck, batch size too small (leads to resource under-utilized), etc.
- Training environment Python package versions are the same as inference package versions
- NDC is a JupyterHub
