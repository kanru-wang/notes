If I flip a coin N times and get A heads, the probability of getting heads on toss N + 1 is (A + 1) / (N + 2)

If on Amazon there are two sellers, one has 10/10 good rating and the other has 48/50 good rating. Which one should I choose?

- (10 + 1) / (10 + 2) = 91.7%
- (48 + 1) / (50 + 2) = 94.2%

Therefore I should choose the seller with 48/50 good rating.
