- Entropy can be used as a measure of uncertainty of multi-class classification
- The formula of entropy has its shape because it is the only family of functions that satisfies the four basic properties

From my experience

- Although [0.8, 0.2, 0, 0, 0] has a lower entropy than [0.8, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], sometimes the size of the gap between the highest and 2nd highest is more important than the entropy value.
- Sometimes caliberation is required before calculating the entropy.
