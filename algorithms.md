## Analysis of Algorithms

    - (c): What is the constant factor?
    - (n0): From what point onward is f(n) smaller?
    - Case analysis -- Need Case Analysis when runtime is affected by input properties besides n.
    - Big Theta only exists when Big-O == Big-Omega
    - Big-O and Big-Omega do not have to be tight, but in industry, people often use Big-Oh to mean “Tight Big-Oh” and use it even when a Big-Theta exists
