- Frequency, r, is how many times a certain type of species have been observed.
- Frequency of frequency, Nr, is how many types of species of frequency r have been observed. E.g. N1 = 120 means there are 120 types of species that each has been observed 1 time.
- The probability that the next observed individual is a unseen species is equal to count of observed individual that is seen 1 time divided by count of all observed individual.
- Can also estimate the probability that the next observed individual is from a species which has been seen r times.
- Can also estimate the probability that the next observed individual is from any species from this group (i.e., the group of species seen r times).
